### Why did you choose the libraries, frameworks, technologies, and/or UI elements you used?

Vue is great for small projects like this. PrimeVue is my ui library of preference. Vueuse is pretty much a standard library for any vue project.

### Is there anything you would improve if you had more time and resources?

I would handle errors in more elegant way and implement auto-reconnect. I would come up with more efficient data structure for transactions.

### Is there anything about your solution that you’re really proud of that you’d like to share?

It was a pretty simple project, if anything I'm proud that I consider one as such.
